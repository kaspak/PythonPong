## PythonPong
Creating a Python GUI Pong game with a guided tutorial from Christian Thompson. (Base game)
I plan experimenting and improving the base code with a better implementation.

### Current Features:
- [X] 1. Set up window using Turtle.
- [X] 2. Create paddles A & B.
- [X] 3. Create ball.
- [X] 4. Create a score board.

- [X] 5. Functionality:
  - [X] a. Listening to keyboard inputs to move paddles A & B.
  - [X] b. Moving the ball starting at the center.
  - [X] c. Making the ball bounce (reverse direction) off border walls (top & bottom).
  - [X] d. Making the ball bounce off paddles.
  - [X] e. Changing player scores when ball hits player's border wall.
  
### Plan to Add:
- [ ] 1. Implement a start screen
  - [ ] a. Allows players to input player names. 
  - [ ] b. Input a limit in points (ends game when limit is met).
  - [ ] c. Automatically quit game by pressing 'q/Q'.

### Optional Additions:
- [ ] 1. Introduce a difficulty mode of adding more pong balls as points increase.
